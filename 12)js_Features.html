    // --------------sloppy mode--------//

        /* 
        strict mode better and more secure code 
        
        it doesnt apply to the block code


        ex:- 
        x=20;

        console.log(x);

        // here the value will be excuted without any mistakes, but we didnt provide a neat declaration 
        like let x=20;

        so inorder to avoid these type of errors in code we use strict mode

        on the top of the code we going to write as

        "use strict";

        then the code will which has written, will started to use in strict mode itself


        "use strict";

        x = 10;
        console.log(x);

        // x is not defined error will be shown

        we shouldnt use same type of varibles in a declaration of values in a function .

        var NaN = 10;

        is not a number is a error while using strict mode 

        so Strict mode will really help full to write a secure code.



        **** Released with ES5,  It tells browser to change the way that execute Js. Helps to write better and more secure code.

        JavaScript: -

        highlevel multi-paradigam object-oriented scripting language


        feature: -

        1> High-level language: -

                                    Every program that runs on your computer needs some hardware resources,such as memory and 
                the CPU to do its work. low-level languages, such as C,where you have to manually manage these resources.
                ou have high-level languages such as JavaScript and Python, where we do not have to manage resources at all 
                because these languages have so-called abstractions that take all of that work away from us. the language 
                easier to learn and to use, but the downside is that programs will never be as fast or as optimized as 
                for example, C programs.
         
         Memory management is going to take care by language itself


        2) garbage collection: - 
        
                           one of the powerful tools that takes memory management away from developers is garbage-collection,
                        which is basically an algorithm inside the JavaScript engine, which automatically removes old, unused 
                        objects.from the computer memory in order not to clog it up with unnecessary stuff.which cleans  
                        memory from time to time so that we don't have to do it manually in our code.


        where dead code will be through in garbage collection, time to time it will clean the memory


        3) Js is Interpreted language: - 

         JavaScript is an interpreted or just-in-time compiled language.the computer's processor only understands 
         zeros and ones.  which is also called machine code. this code eventually needs to be translated to machine 
         code. And that step can be either compiling or interpreting. this happens inside the JavaScript engine.

                       
        just in time compilation(JIT)

        code will be executed line by line.
         

        4) Multi - paradigam: -

                              A paradigm is an approach and an overall mindset of structuring our code, which will ultimately direct 
                    the coding style and technique in a project that uses a certain paradigm.  three popular paradigms are procedural, 
                    object-oriented, and functional programming.So procedural programming is what we've been doing so far,which is basically just
                     organizing the code in a very linear way, and then with some functions in between. we can classify paradigms as imperative 
                     or as declarative, many languages are only procedural or only object-oriented or only functional,but JavaScript does all of 
                     it. So it's really flexible and versatile. And so we can do really whatever we want with it.


                 Js supports all type of programming language

        procedural oriented - 

        fuctional oriented -

        object oriented -

        5) Prototype-based OOP: -

                       Everything in JavaScript is an object, except for primitive values such as numbers, strings, etc. 
                    But arrays are just object. Now,  we can create an array and then use the push method on it, for example? 
                Well, it's because of prototypal inheritance. Basically, we create arrays from an array blueprint, which is 
                like a template and this is called the prototype. This prototype contains all the array methods and the 
            arrays that we create in our code then inherit the methods from the blueprint so that we can use them on the arrays. 


        6) first class function: - 

        first-class functions, which simply means that functions are treated just as regular variables. 
        so, we can pass functions into other functions and we can even return functions from functions. and this allows for 
        functional-programming, which is one of the paradigms and actually not all languages have first-class functions.


        7) Js is Dynamic Language & loossly coupled

        We don't assign data types to variables. Instead, they only became known when the JavaScript engine executes code. Also,
        the type of variables can easily be changed as we reassign variables. And this is basically what dynamically-typed means.


        8) Js is Single threaded and Synchronous language and behave asynchronously
           and Non-Blocking event loop...

           That means how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.


           jS is a hoisted language by the browser.
